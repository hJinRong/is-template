​One day the wind said to the sun, “Look at that man walking along the road. I can get his cloak off more quickly than
you can.”

“We will see about that,” said the sun. “I will let you try first.”

So the wind tried to make the man take off his cloak. He blew and blew, but the man only pulled his cloak more closely
around himself.

“I give up,” said the wind at last. “I cannot get his cloak off.” Then the sun tried. He shone as hard as he could. The
man soon became hot and took off his cloak.
